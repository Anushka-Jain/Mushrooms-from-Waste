Through extensive research, we discovered Italians' deep love for mushrooms, consuming them in various forms, from raw to cooked. 
Yet, the problem of waste loomed large. Inefficient waste management practices posed environmental challenges.

**That's when inspiration struck - why not produce mushrooms from waste? ‚ôªÔ∏èüçÑ**

We envisioned a program, "Sustainable Agriculture & Italian Food and Wine," led by students, for students, and involving professors, experts, and the local community. 
This initiative had the potential to tackle four UN Sustainable Development Goals: 
1. Zero Hunger,
2. Decent Work and Economic Growth,
3. Industry, Innovation & Infrastructure, and
4. Responsible Consumption & Production.
   
Our plan involved everyone, from students to professors, and promised economic gains through profits from mushroom sales, with university cafeterias as potential buyers.
